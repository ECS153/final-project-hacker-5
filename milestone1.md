# ECS 153 Hacker 5 Group: Milestone #1
####
## Meeting Notes:
### Changing Project Topics:
The main aspect of this meeting was to focus on our new project idea after we realized the first one didn't meet the expectations of the assignment.
We disussed several ideas, such as checking app permissions on Android devices, before reaching an agreement about our new project proposal: Building our own messaging application with custom encryption methods.

### Messaging App With Custom Encryption:
For this project, we identified mesibo, an open source messaging platform that provides SDKs and APIs for multiplatform applications. We decided to use the framework of mesibo to build our own secure messaging application. Once the basic implementation is up and running, we then intend to implement our own custom encryption algorithm to (add things here).

Action Items:
For this upcoming week, we identified several tasks that need to be done so that we remain on track.
1. Read through the mesibo documentation and understand the basic structure of the application
2. Begin building a simplistic, minimally functioning app based on the framework and ensure it works as intended.
3. Research different encryption algorithms that we can add to the app, noting performance and reliability differences.
4. Determine how to add our own encryption system and methods to the app instead of using the pre-built one.

### Individual Notes:

#### Abdullah: This weeks goal is to get started with the Mesibo API and set up a 1 to 1 messaging interface in the application. and then look up some encryption techniques to integrate them with our messaging app.
