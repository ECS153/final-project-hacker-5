# ECS 153 Hacker 5 Group: Milestone #2
####
## Meeting Notes:
### Deciding on the details of the implementation:
For this meeting, our objective was to determine the technical aspects we will implement in the project. We decided on several utilities and attacks to include in our implementation:

1. Network Scanner to scan open ports of a target host.
2. Banner scanner to detect potential vulnerabilites among network devices and choose attack target.
3. SSH and FTP attacks through brute forcing to take advantage of common security lapses among users.
4. Sniffing and spoofing: Common network attacks where we detect the individual network activity of targets and potentially pose as them sending out traffic.
5. Implementing a reverse shell: A technique used for target machine to communicate back to the attacking machine. The attacking machine receives the connection via a listener port. 
6. A keylogger: A technique used to record keystrokes to decipher user's sensitive information.

### Individual Notes:

#### Abdullah: 
I will be working on sniffing and spoofing attacks for this week
#### Aziz:
I'm working on setting up the bruteforce attacks among devices and examining how to detect network traffic. Once traffic detection is done then spoofing would be the next step.
#### Jasmine:
I am working on keylogger currently and then will be working on Reverse Shell with Obaid. 
#### Matthew:
I am working on the banner scanner to scan for port vulnerabilities. I also plan on working on the SSH and FTP attacks.
#### Obaid:
My task is to examine and begin the implementation of the reverse shell which will be a core part of our attacks.
