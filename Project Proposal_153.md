## Problem:
Oftentimes we connect our devices to wireless networks that we do not completely trust, such as restaurants, cafes and more. However, these networks public or private can be compromised or have malicious users who try to gain access to other users’ data illegally. As a result, users are susceptible to man-in-the-middle attacks, snooping and sniffing, distributing malware attacks over unsecured wifi networks, and malicious attacks through ad-hocs. This could lead to sensitive information leaking, bandwidth theft, and illegal usage of any user’s computer system.

## Importance
This problem is important because we don’t want people hacking into our devices and stealing our valuable information such as credit-cards, photos and more. Also, people aren’t aware that it is simply not safe to connect to public wifi. Hence, the big motivation for our project is to explore how much damage can occur to a user who is connected to a compromised or a malicious network and make a demo of what kind of data can be leaked including social-media accounts.

## Plan
We will have two computers on the same network, where we use one computer to hack the other using various methods such as Nmap, SQL-injecting, packet-sniffing via Wireshark, and password guessing (brute force and dictionary attacks). We will also explore various tools and packages in Kali Linux to achieve our goal. The target computer can try to defend those attacks using VPN and Tor to test their security. We will also try some defense techniques by writing a program to defend some of those attacks that can be implemented in public networks.

## Expected Results
We expect to extract some sensitive data from targeted users who are connected to the malicious network. Then, we would like to demo how much effort it takes to attack users and what data these attacks yield.
