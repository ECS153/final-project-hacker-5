# ECS 153 Hacker 5 Group: Milestone #3
####
## Meeting Notes:
### Deciding on the details of the implementation:
For this meeting, our objective was to determine the technical aspects we will implement in the project. We decided on several utilities and attacks to include in our implementation:

1. Network Scanner to scan open ports of a target host.
2. Banner scanner to detect potential vulnerabilites among network devices and choose attack target.
3. SSH and FTP attacks through brute forcing to take advantage of common security lapses among users.
4. Sniffing and spoofing: Common network attacks where we detect the individual network activity of targets and potentially pose as them sending out traffic.
5. Implementing a reverse shell: A technique used for target machine to communicate back to the attacking machine. The attacking machine receives the connection via a listener port. 
6. A keylogger: A technique used to record keystrokes to decipher user's sensitive information.

### Individual Notes:

#### Abdullah: 
I am currently working on reverse shell
#### Aziz:
I'm working on setting up the bruteforce attacks among devices and examining how to detect network traffic. Once traffic detection is done then spoofing would be the next step.
#### Jasmine:
I am working on keylogger currently and then will be working on Reverse Shell with Abdullah. 
#### Matthew:
I am currently working on the ARP scanner
#### Obaid:
I am currently working on SSH and FTP attacks.
